# Network10Lib
C# library for handling TCP connection for your game or application. Completely async for best performance.

## Why use this library
C# provides a TcpClient class as well as TcpListener for tcp communication. This library is basically a wrapper around those classes with additional features.
1. TcpConnectionN10 class can be opened as a Server or as a Client. It is both in a single class, which makes you code a lot easier to write.
2. Everthing is async which makes your code much more readable.
3. The library automatically JSON-Serializes your data.
4. It is a lightweight library which is easy to understand and easy to customize.

## How does it work?
There are two demo Projects: One with Windows Froms and one with WPF. Use those Project as a Guidline for your Project.
